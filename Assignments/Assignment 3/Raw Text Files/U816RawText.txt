Crafting the ‘Fastest Ice on Earth’
6:32 minutes
More from this episode
Marc Norman is something of an ice doctor. At Salt Lake City’s Utah Olympic Oval, he obsessively monitors the ice and air temperatures, humidity, and purity of the water. His aim? Creating what he calls the “fastest ice on earth”—in other words, the ice on which speed skaters have forged the most world records.
