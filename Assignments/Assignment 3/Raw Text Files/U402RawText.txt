Celtic to ban biased newspapers from Celtic Park (Parkhead)

Terry King started this petition to Celtic Football Club
With the amount of negativity flowing from certain media outlets regarding Celtic FC and former players we request that unless unbiased reporting can be achieved that they be banned from Celtic Park or any media event that may be held. We have our own channel and media outlets that Celtic fans follow and we do not need biased news from second rate newspapers/outlets.
 
We are addressing Peter Lawell and the rest of the Celtic board/shareholders to implement this ban until unbiased reporting can be achieved which is unlikely.
