The Winter Olympics started last week. In years past, I tuned in to some of the events but didn’t go out of my way to watch beyond some of the feature events. I know there are people who are avid viewers of the Olympic games, and I am wondering where you fall.
Today’s poll is unrelated to domain names. Are you watching the Olympics?
