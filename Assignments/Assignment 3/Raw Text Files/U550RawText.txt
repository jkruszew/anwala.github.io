South Korean figure skater Yura Min did not let a sartorial setback ruin her 2018 Winter Olympic ambitions.
A clasp on her red dress slipped just seconds into her pairs figure skating routine on Sunday.
It was the first Olympic event for her and partner Alexander Gamelin, and Min had to readjust her dress several times throughout the dance.
However, the pair continued, scoring 51.97 points and finishing in ninth place.

"If that comes undone, the whole thing could just pop off. I was terrified the entire programme."
