Feb 09, 2018
BOSTON – The Suffolk women's indoor track & field team put its talent to the test as the Rams took on some of the top runners across all divisions in New England Friday, Feb. 9 at Boston University's David Hemery Valentine Invitational at BU's Track & Field Tennis Center. 
A pair of freshman Rams – Mariama Kamara and Dakhensey Marcellus – were in the field of 51 runns in the 60 M dash. Kamara's time of 8.28 put the Chelsea, Massachusetts, native in the middle of the heat in 24th, while Marcellus placed 45th with a time of 8.92. 
Emily Manfra crossed the 1000 M finish line in 3:05.44 to take 61st overall in a field of 78. Emma Weisse competed in the most popular event on Friday, the mile. The sophomore from Stoneham, Massachusetts, put together a 5:12.97 mile to finish 128 out of 246 runners. 
Suffolk officially wrapped up its inaugural indoor season as a team on Friday, but Manfra and Weisse have more work to do as the pair qualified for the New England Division III Indoor Championships, which are set to take place this weekend, Saturday, Feb. 17 at Springfield College.
