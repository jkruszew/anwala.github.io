Edinson Cavani expects Cristiano Ronaldo to be at his most dangerous when Paris Saint-Germain face Real Madrid in the Champions League last 16.
The Portugal star struggled badly for form in domestic competition in the first half of the season, scoring just four goals in 15 LaLiga appearances.
The 33-year-old has shown signs of returning to his very best in 2018, though, hitting seven goals in his last three league matches, including a hat-trick in Saturday’s 5-2 win over Real Sociedad.
Ronaldo has also remained consistent in Europe, netting nine goals in Madrid’s six group games this term, and Cavani does not think he will struggle to make his mark when his PSG side visit the Santiago Bernabeu on Wednesday.

“Well, he has more experience than me and I’m sure he’ll know how to get out of this situation,” he told Marca when asked about Ronaldo’s relative struggles. 
“I believe that this won’t make him uncomfortable, being the kind of forward that he is, with such self-belief.
“As a forward, you know these things happen. In one match, this motivation can come back.”
Cavani himself has been in lethal form this term, with 28 goals in all competitions helping PSG to maintain their challenge for a clean sweep of trophies.
However, the Uruguay international does not anticipate their being many goals in the first leg of the Madrid tie.
“We’re in a great moment, really, working well in every tournament. There’s some stumbling, but that’s logical. Football is like that,” he said.
“We’ve signed important people and that adds up to a lot. It gives us confidence on the pitch. It motivates us for every challenge, including this Champions League, of course.
