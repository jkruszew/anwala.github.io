Juventus top 10 for squad cost
By Football Italia staff
Juventus are in the top 10 in Europe in terms of how much their squad cost to assemble, with Milan, Roma and Inter in the top 20 and Napoli 21st.
Today the CIES Football Observatory has released it’s squad recruitment cost list, updated after the January transfer window.
Juventus are the only Italian side to make the top 10, sitting eighth with a squad which cost €448m, according to the organisation.
That figure is dwarfed by the top teams on the list, with Manchester City paying €878m to assemble their squad.
Paris Saint-Germain are second with €805m, with Manchester United on €747m and Barcelona on €725m.
In addition, of the most expensive members of the Juve squad is Gianluigi Buffon, but his €52m fee was paid to Parma in 2001.
Milan’s squad cost the second most of any Italian team, with the Rossoneri spending €305m on their team, much of which was last summer after the takeover by Yonghong Li.
Roma come in 17th with a squad which cost €262m, while Inter lie 20th on €217m.
Napoli are outside of the top 20, spending €204m on their squad to assemble the 21st most expensive team in Europe.
That means, according to CIES Football Observatory their squad cost less than half of what the Juve squad which sits a point behind them in the league cost.
