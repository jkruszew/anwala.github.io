A video of Alvaro Morata dancing and holding his wife in his arms has had an angry response from some Chelsea fans with the player having been out of action for a month with a shoulder injury.
Coach Antonio Conte said last Friday that he did not know when the player would return and he has gone to see the well-known German doctor Peter Wehling in the hope of being ready to face Barcelona in the Champions League.
