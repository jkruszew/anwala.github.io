RAMONA, CA â€“ Chris Knierim, who was raised in Ramona, will resume competition Tuesday as an Olympic bronze medalist.
Knierim won the medal as part of the U.S team in the figure skating team event that concluded Sunday (California time) in Gangneung, South Korea.
Knierim, a pairs skater whose partner is his wife, Alexa Scimeca- Knierim, did not skate Sunday. Their portion of the event ended Saturday with a fourth-place finish in their free skate that was worth seven points and left the U.S. with 36 points, one more than fourth-place Italy.
Sunday's competition began with Adam Rippon finishing third in the men's free skate, increasing the U.S. lead over Italy to two.
Mirai Nagasu was second in the ladies free skate after becoming the first American woman to land a triple Axel at the Olympic Games, increasing the U.S. lead over Italy to four.
The team event concluded with the U.S. brother-and-sister duo of Maia and Alex Shibutani finishing second in the free dance.
The U.S. finished third with 62 points, six more than fourth-place Italy. Canada won with 73 points. Olympic Athletes from Russia was second with 66.
A first-place finish is worth 10 points, with each place further down worth one less.
The U.S. also won the bronze medal in 2014, the first time the team event was held at the Winter Olympics.
Knierim and Scimeca-Knierim are set to next skate Tuesday in the pairs short program.
