PYEONGCHANG, South Korea — Mikaela Shiffrin’s quest for multiple gold medals will have to wait.
The giant slalom, Shiffrin’s first race at the Pyeongchang Olympics, was postponed Monday because of strong winds. The men’s downhill was canceled Sunday for the same reason.
There was no immediate decision on when the GS will be held.
Shiffrin could race all five events in Pyeongchang and will be the gold-medal favorite in at least three of them: slalom, GS and Alpine combined. She’s the reigning Olympic champion in slalom.
