Streaming The Olympics
Yesterday morning something amusing happened.
My friend and I were headed out to go skiing and we both got texts from our children asking for the logins to our cable accounts.
I thought to myself that there must be tens of thousands of those text messages being sent at that moment.
Many of our adult children don’t have cable television. They stream their media over their laptops and AppleTVs.
And so when something big like the Olympics comes along, they head over to the network’s streaming services and they need to log in with their cable television credentials. Which, of course they don’t have. But their parents do.
This has been going on in our family for some time, but I realized yesterday that this goes on in many families these days.
The parents are still on cable, the kids are not, and at times, the kids need their parent’s logins.
The entire system is kind of whacky and designed to preserve the cable company’s relationships with the networks. It works, but it is clunky, and easily worked around.
I wonder how long this charade will continue before a better model emerges.
