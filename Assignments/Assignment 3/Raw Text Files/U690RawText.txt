The Winter Olympics is shaping up to be a Marvel-ous one for the US Olympic ski and snowboard teams who will be sporting outfits inspired by the modern look of Captain Marvel and the Marvel Cinematic Universe design of Captain America.

The men and women’s teams will be decked out by suits that are part of a collaboration between Marvel and Spyder, the US ski team’s official supplier. Spyder announced a two-year partnership with Disney Consumer Products and Interactive Media last Thursday, specifically to make superhero-themed performance products for athletes. The suits, however, officially debuted last February at the FIS Alpine World Ski Championships in St. Moritz, Switzerland.
The suits that will be seen at the games, which are taking place in Pyeongchang, South Korea, were designed by retired alpine ski racer and Olympic gold medalist Julia Mancuso. The attire caught fire on social media with enthusiastic responses to these comic book-inspired designs from fans who are looking forward to seeing Captain America in May’s  Avengers: Infinity War and Brie Larson as Carol Danvers in the Captain Marvel solo flick  next year.
