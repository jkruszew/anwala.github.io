NBC declares wrong Olympic winner, won't even admit it screwed up
The alliance of North and South Korean Olympic hockey teams was skating on thin ice Saturday when cheerleaders from the Hermit Kingdom appeared to wear masks depicting the nation’s first Communist leader, Kim Il Sung.
The cheerleaders — dubbed North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s “army of beauties” — were rooting on the Korean hockey team composed of players from the North and South as they got trounced by Switzerland.
The cheer squad whipped out masks depicting a young man’s face during a rendition of the Korean song “Whistle,” and local media reported it was the likeness of Kim Il Sung — sparking protests by those fearing that the North would only use the Games as a propaganda tool, according to Yonhap News Agency.
But the South’s Ministry of Unification confirmed Sunday that it was a case of mistaken identity, the outlet reported.
After checking with a North Korean official at the scene, it has been confirmed that there was “no such meaning whatsoever, as assumed in the report,” the ministry said in a release.
The image was meant to be a generic, attractive-looking young man, the ministry said, citing the North Korean official.
