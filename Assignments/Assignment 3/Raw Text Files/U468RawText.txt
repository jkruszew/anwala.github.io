Mirai Nagasu has become the first American woman — and third overall — to land a triple Axel in the Olympics, accomplishing the rare feat in the women's free skate at the team competition in Pyeongchang.
The 24-year-old from Montebello, California, skated first of the five women and led off her routine with the triple Axel just 21 seconds in. The feat drew huge cheers from the crowd at the Gangneung Ice Arena.
