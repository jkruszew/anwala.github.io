If you're an Olympics fan like me, you know how long the two-year wait between events can seem. To help you make it through those long seasons without international sports, I've got 21 books about the Olympics you should read A.S.A.P.
I don't really care for sports , except on certain occasions: my niece and nephew's games, the World Series, and the Olympics. Every two years, I get the chance to bug my family into watching figure skating, gymnastics, swimming, martial arts, fencing, volleyball, and football, and it's great.
The Olympics has a long and rich history , one that's worth exploring in your nightly reading. No matter whether you would rather read about particular Olympians, key moments in Olympic history , or wide-lens examinations of the games and events, there is at least one book you will enjoy on the list below.
The 21 books about the Olympics that I've picked out for you to read cover the last 100 years or so in international sports. There are microhistories on the Olympic games of yesteryear, as well as biographies on famous Olympic athletes Alice Coachman, Betty Robinson, and Babe Didrikson Zaharias, among others. You'll also find some memoirs from former Olympic and Paralympic athletes.
