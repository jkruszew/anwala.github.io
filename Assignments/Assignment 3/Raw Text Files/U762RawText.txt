© Jeff Swinger-USA TODAY Sports Dec 10, 2017; Kerns, UT, USA; Ted-Jan Bloemen of Canada races the men's 5000-meter race at Utah Olympic Oval. Two medals in the men’s 5,000 metre speedskating event at the Olympics in Pyeongchang were decided by the tiniest of margins.
Dutch speedskater Sven Kramer won gold in the event for the third time in a row, but it was the silver and bronze medals that involved the photo finish.
Canadian Ted-Jan Bloemen got the silver while Norway’s Sverre Lunde Pedersen took home bronze when it was determined that Bloemen finished ahead by two thousandths of a second.

Now that is what we call a photo finish.
Bloemen’s silver gave Canada its third medal of the day at the Olympics.
The only time we’ve seen a closer photo finish was when two sprinters actually tied at the Olympic trials in 2012 .
