To mark the fourth day of Winter Olympics 2018 in Pyeongchang, South Korea, Google has come up with another colourful Google Doodle.
Google Doodle Snow Games Day 4. Google.
One thing that stands out in these doodles is the emphasis that has been given to the four trademark colours of Olympics namely, red, yellow, green, and blue.
In this animated Doodle there is an elephant, turtle, cat, squirrel, armadillo, bear and a penguin. These animated folks are competing against each other in a snowboarding competition on their colourful snowboards.
The Doodle opens up with these animated creatures waiting enthusiastically for the competition to begin. The race begins from a Pagoda-like structure. Here the elephant can be seen leading the race followed by the bear. The slow and steady turtle can be seen racing last.
The snowboarding race  comprises  skiing, surfing and skateboarding. This game was introduced in Olympics quite late in 1998.
The Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang will take place from 9 February to 25 February 2018.
Dubbed the Doodle Snow Games, every day, a different doodle will appear. This was the fourth doodle, in a collection of seventeen doodles which is slated to come marking the athletic gaming event.
The first doodle which was released on 9 February, was also an animation where all animals were seen playing different sports which are a part of the games.
A total of 92 countries are participating in this mammoth of an event.
