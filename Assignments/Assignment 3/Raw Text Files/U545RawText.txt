Nigerian Coach Slaps Fellow Coach During A Football Match Over This Reason
Posted by: tony in Sports Feb 12, 2018
It was indeed an embarrassing moment when the Kwara United head coach, Maji Mohammed slapped his counterpart, Katsina United’s team manager Abdulahi Biffo in the Week 8 game of the Nigerian Professional Football League (NPFL).
Trouble started when a Kwara United defender committed a foul in his own 18 yard box, but the referee pointed to the corner flag that it was corner-kick. However, the Katsina United captain complained that it was a penalty and not a corner kick.
After the final whistle, the Katsina coach entered the field to send his players out off the pitch to stop them from causing any trouble, that was when the Kwara United coach moved into the pitch and slapped him.
People however rushed in to separate the two coaches before any serious damage was done.
