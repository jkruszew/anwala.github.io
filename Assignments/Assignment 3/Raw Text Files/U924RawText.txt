Rosters to Target for Instant Fantasy Impact: AFC North
February 12, 2018
in Dynasty Buys & Sells , Dynasty Spotlight
During the free agency period and rookie draft season you’ll see many write-ups about how a player ended up in the perfect “Landing Spot.” Even if you’re an advocate of talent over landing spot, you have to admit that landing plays a role in a players production. DFF has decided to take a look at every team, broken down by division, to see which teams roster lend themselves to instant production or at least the speculation for immediate production at specific positions. We can target players that land on these rosters either for short-term fixes, instant production or as flip candidates.
AFC North:
Position looking for instant impact:
Tight End
Why this Roster:
Since I’ve limited myself to “instant impact” that leaves me with few choices on the Steelers roster. Ben Roethlisberger could retire tomorrow, or he could play for another three seasons now that mean old Todd Haley is gone. If Le’Veon Bell doesn’t come to terms with Pittsburgh then James Connors is worth a stash, but that seems unlikely (at the moment). Wide receiver is set with AB, Smith-Schuster, Martavis Bryant and Eli Rogers. 
This leaves us with the fullback or tight end positions to look to for value. Since it’s not 1982, I selected the Tight End position. On this weeks DynastyTradesHQ podcast episode I wrongly assumed the lack of TE production was due to Todd Haley not utilizing the position. After further review, the issue is more likely the lack of talent at the position. In 2017 Jesse James finished as the TE22 (overall), in 2016 he was the TE28. Conversely, Heath Miller was able to finish as the TE16 in 2015, TE12 in 2014 and TE17 in 2013, his final three seasons.
James is a free agent after the 2018 season and has failed to impress. Vance McDonald has great measurables, but can’t stay healthy or catch and can be cut with no dead cap after the 2018 season. The Steelers could draft any one of Troy Fumagalli, Dallas Goedert, Hayden Hurst, Mark Andrews or Penn State alum Mik Gesicki to address the position long-term. 
Baltimore Ravens:
Position looking for instant impact:
Wide Receiver
Why this Roster:
Mike Wallace is an unrestricted free agent. Jeremy Maclin looked utterly washed in 2017 and could end up being cut. Ben Watson and Michael Campanaro are both free agents. Those four players accounted for 270 targets in 2017, and someone is going to have to catch the ball. I would love to tout Breshad Perriman except that he regressed so badly last season I doubt the Raven’s will count on him in any capacity next year.
This season’s free agency class has a plethora of wide receivers available, Allen Robinson, Jarvis Landry, and Marqise Lee among them. Marqise Lee is my preference based on his current cost and my expectation that he would succeed in Baltimore, though I doubt Ozzie Newsome is clamoring for my thoughts on the matter. 
Cleveland Browns:
Position looking for instant impact:
Quarterback, Wide receiver, Running back
Why this Roster:
The issue with the Browns roster isn’t going to be finding value when the QB, RB, and WR positions are fortified. No, the issue is going to be the cost. If the Browns, as expected, draft a quarterback and running back with the 1st and 4th overall picks in the draft you’re not buying either of those players on the cheap. If for some reason the Browns pass on those positions in the 1st round then we’ll talk.
An early round, 2nd or 3rd round, draft pick spent on a wide receiver could be intriguing. I love Corey Coleman as much, if not more than anyone, but he has yet to break out. Josh Gordon’s history is well known, and he is always a risk. A wide receiver with some pedigree like Michael Gallup could easily slide onto the starting roster and cause a lot of damage in year one. On the free-agency front Jarvis Landry would look good in a Browns jersey, well as good as anyone can look in orange and brown. Landry could catch 120 passes for 999 yards next season with Coleman and Gordon occupying the majority of the secondary’s attention. 
Cincinnati Bengals:
Position looking for instant impact:
Wide Receiver
Why this Roster:
At no point during the draft process last year was I a fan of John Ross. After he landed with Marvin Lewis, I liked Ross even less. Ross’s rookie season was an abject failure, and I’m already chalking him up to bust status. After spending 2nd and 1st round draft picks at the WR position the last two years it would be a shock if the Bengals went ahead and spent similar capital this year. But the Bengal’s also brought back Marvin Lewis for yet another season, so who knows what runs through that brain trusts collective mind. Either way, the 2nd WR role on the roster is still available for someone’s taking, and another highly drafted WR could come in and take that role.
Thanks for reading as always!
