​It's always fun to play a game of, "Hey, remember this baseball guy?"
But it's never fun when that game ends in, "Oh, wow, looks like that guy got arrested for having an absolute ton of drugs."
According to police reports, Esteban Loaiza, the hurler who started the 2003  ​All-Star Game , was booked in San Diego with 20 kilos of either heroin or cocaine.
He'll face a judge on Wednesday.
This is a new one: Esteban Loaiza, drug kingpin.
The second-winningest pitcher from Mexico in MLB history was arrested Friday with 20 kilos of heroin or cocaine, according to San Diego police records. He'll be in court Wednesday to face felony drug charges. Details are in pics. pic.twitter.com/312pf21Q4F

​​Loaiza, a middling pitcher over the course of his career, yet still a Mexican baseball legend, famously flamed out in the Bronx after a  ​midseason trade  in 2004, posting an ERA well north of 8.00 after an All-Star first half (albeit one with a 4.86 ERA). He was thought to be a missing piece in a Yankees rotation that, it turns out, was missing enough pieces to collapse in the ALCS.
At this level of possession, it's earnestly fair to call Loaiza a kingpin. We have no idea how we lost track of his status so far that he dipped into this level of illicit dealings.
Sometimes, it's best not to check in on these folks.
