Germany's Joachim Low avoids speculation over Bayern Munich future
Joachim Low is among the contenders to replace Jupp Heynckes at Bayern Munich.
Germany coach Joachim Low has remained coy on his future amid links to Bayern Munich.
The 58-year-old has been named in recent weeks as a potential candidate to replace Jupp Heynckes, who returned to Bayern in October as a caretaker until the end of the season.
Heynckes' impressive record at the Allianz Arena has left Bayern's hierarchy hoping he might commit himself to the Bundesliga champions for another season. However, the 72-year-old Heynckes has been clear about his plans to return to retirement after the end of the season.
Low joins a long list of possible Bayern coaches, with former Borussia Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel, Frankfurt's Niko Kovac and RB Leipzig's Ralph Hasenhuttl all among those considered to be in contention.
Speaking to Sky during Saturday's game between Bayern Munich and Schalke, Low remained coy on his future.
"I am under contract at the DFB until 2020," Low said. "My focus is on the World Cup now. I don't think about what will be after that."
Low, who has led Germany since 2006, also praised Heynckes, who missed Saturday's match with a cold.
"Jupp does a sensational job," Low said. "Bayern, like many fans in Germany, surely want him to continue."
