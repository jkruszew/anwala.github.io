Mourinho must win Premier League next season, warns Neville

Jose Mourinho “has to win” the Premier League title with Manchester United next season, according to Gary Neville.
Defeat to Newcastle on Sunday leaves United 16 points behind current leaders Manchester City, who are almost certain to take the crown.
Mourinho’s side are still second but the gap to Liverpool is now just two points, and Chelsea could be only three points behind come Monday evening.
After finishing sixth last campaign, second place would represent an improvement, but Neville says the title has to be delivered in his third season.
“The individual talent is there but to coordinate that into a team is Jose Mourinho’s job in the next few months. He has to make them into a team,” he told the Gary Neville Podcast.
“They look like a team that play five per cent below the intensity that they can play at and should play at. That’s what Jose Mourinho has to do. He has to mould this talented group of players into a team that can come together and can win the title.
“Next season will be Jose’s third season and you would think in his mind, and in everyone’s minds, that he has to win it next season. They have to start preparing now and days like today do damage confidence and take away the work you are trying to do.
“I still think they will finish second and they are still in the FA Cup and Champions League so there is a lot to play for, but they still have these moments where they let games drift. They missed chances, they are sloppy in the final third so many times and they have to improve that. They have to become killers in the final third and they are not at the moment.”
