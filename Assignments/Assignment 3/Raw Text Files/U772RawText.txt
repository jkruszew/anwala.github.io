TODAY, Dortmund manager Thomas Tuchel blasted Manchester City over what he called a 'blatant attempt' at tapping up Shinji Kagawa.
During a press conference this morning, the Dortmund boss said that it was 'disgraceful' that Manchester City were able to contact the Japanese midfielder without first gaining permission from the club.
The statements come on the back of earlier reports that Manchester City had a â‚¬19 million bid for the player rejected.
