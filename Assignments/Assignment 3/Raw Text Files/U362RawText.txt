Reports have emerged that Real Madrid have renewed their interest in PSG star Angel Di Maria.
This is despite earlier statements from manager Zinedine Zidane, who told reporters that he had no intention in pursuing the Argentine midfielder.
'Real Madrid are looking to swoop in on Di Maria with an â‚¬38 million offer', stated one source.
'And with Di Maria looking to leave PSG, it looks as though it might actually happen.'
