College football programs moved one major step closer to wrapping up the 2018 recruiting cycle on national signing day, but time is precious on the recruiting trail. Coaching staffs have already moved on to 2019, and we're headed there along with them.
At this stage of the recruiting cycle, volume is a significant part of holding a high ranking. For example, that's an enormous reason why BYU—which has never landed a top-25 class, per the 247Sports composite rankings—is currently just outside the top 10.
In other words, things are going to change—a bunch. Ohio State, Oregon, Stanford and Texas each have one verbal pledge, while UCLA and USC are still searching for their first commitment.
They'll eventually start climbing the rankings, but for now, they're chasing the back of the top 25.
25-21. Northwestern, Clemson, Iowa State, North Carolina, West Virginia
1 of 13
25. Northwestern Wildcats
Class size: 3 (Zero 4- or 5-stars)
Commitment to know: Northwestern edged into the Top 25 thanks to a recent verbal pledge from tight end Thomas Gordon . Over the last two seasons, the 3-star from Texas has caught 72 passes for 1,000 yards and 10 touchdowns.
     
24. Clemson Tigers
Class size: 2 (One 4-star)
Commitment to know: Two unofficial visits to Clemson during the past campaign convinced  Joseph Charleston to join the ACC powerhouse's 2019 class. Rated the seventh-best safety in the nation, Charleston is the No. 137 player overall.
      
23. Iowa State Cyclones
Class size: 4 (Zero 4- or 5-stars)
Commitment to know: Wide receiver is a clear priority for Iowa State in 2019. The Cyclones recently seemed to lose 3-star  Maurice Massey , but he remains in the class. Massey is listed as the eighth-best player from Missouri.
     
22. North Carolina Tar Heels
Class size: 3 (One 4-star)
Commitment to know: The prized prospect in the early stages for North Carolina is 4-star athlete  Hakeem Beamon . However, since school's recruitment of him is starting to pick up, the Virginia talent could be a challenge for the rebuilding Tar Heels to keep.
     
21. West Virginia Mountaineers
Class size: 4 (Zero 4- or 5-stars)
Commitment to know: Dana Holgorsen and Co. enjoyed a recent run of success on the trail, securing verbal pledges from two players within a week. Jalen Thornton and Dewayne Grantham  join Lee Kpogba , the No. 473 recruit overall.
20-16. Washington, Auburn, Iowa, TCU, Florida
2 of 13
20. Washington Huskies
Class size: 3 (One 4-star)
Commitment to know: Washington is loading up on quarterbacks. After signing two 4-star signal-callers in the 2018 haul and  likely adding  Georgia transfer Jacob Eason, the Huskies are adding  Dylan Morris , the No. 3 pro-style QB.
          
19. Auburn Tigers
Class size: 2 (Two 4-stars)
Commitment to know: Twelve months out, the battle to replace Jarrett Stidham is intriguing. Auburn recently signed 4-star  Joey Gatewood , and in-state standout  Bo Nix —the top-ranked dual-threat quarterback—pledged to the program in mid-January.
     
18. Iowa Hawkeyes
Class size: 3 (Two 4-stars)
Commitment to know: In unsurprising news, Iowa has secured the state's two best prospects, and they're both offensive linemen. Four-star  Ezra Miller  is ranked No. 235 overall, and  Tyler Endres  is 23 spots behind at No. 258.
     
17. TCU Horned Frogs
Class size: 4 (Zero 4- or 5-stars)
Commitment to know:  William Jones II  will add speed and ball skills to his college home. Last season, the 3-star cornerback notched 36 tackles, nine pass breakups and six interceptions while scoring a pair of return touchdowns on special teams.
          
16. Florida Gators
Class size: 3 (One 4-star)
Commitment to know: Florida already has a stunning nine decommitments in the 2019 cycle, but  Ja'markis Weston  stuck with the program through the change in head coach. The 4-star athlete is listed as the No. 319 prospect overall.
15-11. Ole Miss, Notre Dame, Mississippi State, South Carolina, BYU
3 of 13
15. Ole Miss Rebels
Class size: 4 (One 4-star)
Commitment to know:  Jerrion Ealy  is a versatile stud for in-state Jackson Prep. In 2017, the 4-star rushed for 971 yards and 16 touchdowns on 9.2 yards per carry, adding 34 receptions for 609 yards and 10 scores. Right now, Ealy is the fifth-best running back.
     
14. Notre Dame Fighting Irish
Class size: 3 (Three 4-stars)
Commitment to know:  Jacob Lacey  has already taken two unofficial visits to South Bend and attended a recent junior day. A 6'2", 300-pound defensive tackle, he's the No. 3 prospect from Kentucky and ranked No. 157 overall.
     
13. Mississippi State Bulldogs
Class size: 3 (Two 4-stars)
Commitment to know: After tallying 98 tackles with 22 stops for loss and 14.5 sacks as a sophomore, Charles Moore missed 2017 due to a torn ACL. Coincidentally, it happened on Mississippi State's home field. If Moore sticks with the Bulldogs, the 4-star defensive end has an opportunity to change his memory of Davis Wade Stadium.
     
12. South Carolina Gamecocks
Class size: 7 (Two 4-stars)
Commitment to know: South Carolina edged across the border and snagged 3-star defensive end  Rodricus Fitten  from Atlanta. He's rated No. 23 at the position—as well as No. 335 overall, only trailing wideout  Jamario Holley  in that regard for the Gamecocks.
     
11. BYU Cougars
Class size: 8 (Two 4-stars)
Commitment to know: Defensive end  Chuck Alatini  is ranked 275th nationally and is the No. 1 player from Utah. Fellow defensive lineman Siaki Ika checks in at No. 290 overall, potentially giving BYU the two best in-state prospects for the first time in the 18-year 247Sports' composite ranking era.
10. Michigan State Spartans
