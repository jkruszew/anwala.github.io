Liverpool are expected to launch a shocking â‚¬29 million bid for Barcelona player Jordi Alba.
According to club insiders, Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp is 'hell-bent' on snatching the Spanish left-back away from the Camp Nou.
'Although Barcelona will probably reject Liverpool's advances, Alba is expected to try and force the move.'
'He feels as though his time at Barcelona has come to an end.'
