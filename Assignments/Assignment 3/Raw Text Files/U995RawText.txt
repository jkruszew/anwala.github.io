Sports Direct owner Mike Ashley has tightened his grip on videogames retailer Game Digital with a £3.2m deal to buy half of its Belong esports division.
The sportswear firm bought a 25.8pc stake in Game last year and now plans to introduce concessions of the chain in its own stores along with Belong-branded gaming “arenas” where computer game fans can compete against each other.
Game’s chief executive Martyn Gibbs said the deal would help Game to “move from a seller of physical products to providing gaming experiences” and allow both retailers to “capitalise on the increasing overlap between sports and esports fans”.
The deal means Sports Direct will gain 50pc of Belong’s intellectual property and be entitled to half its profits. It has also agreed to provide Game’s Spanish arm with £55m worth of borrowing facilities, some of which could be used to open new venues.
Mr Gibbs said: “Having launched the Belong brand just over a year ago, we have now opened 19 arenas and are very encouraged by the popularity and performance of these locations.”
Game’s revenues slumped 3.6pc to £783m in the year to 29 July 2017 but were buoyed over Christmas by the popular Nintendo Switch console.
