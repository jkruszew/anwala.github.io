Former Italy striker Mario Balotelli was booked for complaining to the referee about alleged racist chants as his Nice side lost to Dijon. The ex-Manchester City and Liverpool forward was unhappy with the reaction from the home fans when he missed a shot in the 72nd minute, gesturing to the Dijon supporters to be quiet.
He spoke to referee Nicolas Rainville, who showed him a yellow card. Dijon won the game 3-2 with all the goals in the final 30 minutes. The hosts took the lead through Julio Tavares, before Pierre Lees Melou and Alassane Plea put Nice ahead.

But Tavares converted a penalty and Kwon Chang-hoon scored a late winner. Nice president Jean-Pierre Rivere complained about the officiating after the game, although he did not mention Balotelli and was instead angry with the penalty decision.
