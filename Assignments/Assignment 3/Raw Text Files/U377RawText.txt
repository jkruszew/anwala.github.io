Alvaro Morata has hit back at Chelsea fans who criticised him for dancing with his wife despite being sidelined with a back injury.
Alice Campello posted a video on Instagram on Sunday which showed Morata lifting and carrying her during a dance routine.
The striker, who joined Chelsea from Real Madrid for a club-record fee last summer, was criticised by fans for the video as he has missed the club’s last four fixtures with a back problem.
But Morata now claims that the footage is old and has revealed that is available for Chelsea’s clash against West Brom at Stamford Bridge on Monday evening.
‘It’s [an] old video,’ Morata posted on Instagram.
‘I’m not injured, I’m OK for the game tomorrow. A lot of critics now.. but no problem for me!’
Last week, Chelsea boss Antonio Conte was unable to put a timescale on Morata’s recovery.
