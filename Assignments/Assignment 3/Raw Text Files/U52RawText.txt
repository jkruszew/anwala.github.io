PYEONGCHANG â€“ Aksel Lund Svindal (NOR) and Kjetil Jansrud (NOR) can both win a medal in a record fourth alpine skiing discipline when the men's alpine combined is held on Tuesday 13 February at Jeongseon Alpine Centre.
SVINDAL and JANSRUD have both won Olympic medals in downhill, super-G and giant slalom. They could join Kjetil Andre AAMODT (NOR) and Bode MILLER (USA) as the only men in Olympic history to win medals in four different alpine skiing disciplines.
Among women, only Anja PARSON (SWE), Katja SEIZINGER (GER) and Janica KOSTELIC (CRO) have finished on the podium in four different alpine skiing disciplines at the Olympic Winter Games.
SVINDAL (2010, super-G) and JANSRUD (2014, super-G) could join AAMODT (four titles) as the only Norwegian alpine skiers with multiple Olympic gold medals.
Ted Ligety (USA) won the alpine combined at the Torino 2006 Olympic Winter Games and can become the first man to win a combination event twice at the Olympic Winter Games.
LIGETY claimed his only other Olympic medal, also gold, in the men's giant slalom at Sochi 2014. He can become the first alpine skier from the United States to win a third Olympic gold medal.
LIGETY won the alpine combined world title in 2013 and could become the third man to win this event at least three times at the Olympic Winter Games and World Championships combined, after AAMODT (four) and Marc GIRARDELLI (LUX, three).
SVINDAL could also achieve this feat as he won this discipline twice at World Championships, in 2009 and 2011.
AAMODT, MILLER, LIGETY and Lasse KJUS (NOR) are the only men with both an Olympic title and world title in a men's combination event. Luca AERNI (SUI, 2017), Marcel HIRSCHER (AUT, 2015) and SVINDAL (2009 and 2011) could join them with Olympic gold.
Austria has not won a men's combination event at the Olympic Winter Games since Mario REITER won on 13 February 1998. This is Austria's longest gold medal drought in a men's alpine skiing event, just ahead of the super-G (16 February 1998).
Christof INNERHOFER (ITA) bronze medallist in this event in 2014 and LIGETY (two) can join Ivica KOSTELIC (three), MILLER (two), AAMODT (two) and KJUS (two) on multiple Olympic medals in a men's combination event.
Alexis PINTURAULT (FRA) can become the first Frenchman to finish on the podium in this event at the Olympic Winter Games in 70 years as Henri OREILLER (gold) and James COUTTET (bronze) achieved this in 1948.
Norway, Austria, and the United States have won this event a record two times at the Olympic Winter Games.
