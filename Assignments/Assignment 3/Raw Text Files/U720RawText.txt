What Coach Singleton has done with his "Rule of 4", can help any coach improve their offensive output.  This is a great way to streamline your offense and tailor your offense around what your team can be successful with.  With any no huddle tempo offense you want the ability to have your players play fast but also be able to window dress what you do.   The "Rule of 4", is a tool that can make this happen.  The detail that is being spoke on in this course is worth every penny and I will incorporate the "Rule of 4" into my system moving forward.  Thank you coach for putting together a great product!

Coach Singleton has done it again. He has created a course that simplifies your offense while increasing your points. This course shows you how you don't need 1,000 plays in order to be successful. All you need is a couple of plays that you need to rep and your scoring will go through the roof. This is an amazing course that I think everyone should get.

Coach Singleton does a great job of simplifying spread concepts. His rule of 4 is helpful in trying to simplify your offense for your kids in order to play faster, but also gives you answers to what the defense is trying to do. I would recommend any coach looking to simplify their offense in order to play faster check out this course. Nice work Coach!
