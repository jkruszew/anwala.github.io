If you’re looking for a home
You are not alone
I can be your guiding light
Cause I promise you
I’m a dreamer too
Heavy on my heart
When it all counts for something
And your pocket’s full of nothing
Let’s get high on believing
I can promise you
Yes I am a dreamer too
We are dreamers together
Let’s get high on believing
I can promise you
Yes I am a dreamer too
I can promise you
Yes I am a dreamer too
Let’s get high on believing
I can promise you
Yes I am a dreamer too
Heavy on my feet
Walking down the winding road
If you’re looking for a home
You are not alone
I can be your stepping stone
Cause I promise you
I’m a dreamer too
Heavy on my feet
Walking down a winding road
When it all counts for something
And your pockets full of nothing
Let’s get high on believing
I can promise you
Yes I am a dreamer too
We are dreamers together
Let’s get high on believing
I can promise you
Yes I am a dreamer too
I can promise you (repeat)
I can promise you
Yes I am a dreamer too
I can promise you
Yes I am a dreamer too
We are dreamers together
Let’s get high on believing
I can promise you
Yes I am a dreamer too
