Have questions about halfpipe snowboarding? Let Shaun White and other Olympic snowboarders explain. USA TODAY Sports
FILE - In this Feb. 11, 2014, file photo, Shaun White of the United States waves to the crowd after a run during the men's snowboard halfpipe qualifying at the Rosa Khutor Extreme Park, at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Krasnaya Polyana, Russia. White says there were times in the weeks after he slammed his face into a halfpipe in New Zealand and had to be helicoptered off the mountain when he wondered what was to be learned from it all. To outsiders, the answer is simple. The accident served as a jarring reminder of the hurdles White was willing to overcome to make it back to the Olympics, and this time, to leave with a third gold medal.  (AP Photo/Andy Wong, File)

PYEONCHANG, South Korea — Shaun White reached out and hugged me.
That is correct. I was hugged by the Flying Tomato.
Well, me and another reporter. White was talking about rediscovering his passion for snowboarding after the Sochi Olympics, where he finished a disappointing fourth.
“Getting your mindset better is really hard,” he said. “It’s like, if you’ve ever been in a relationship, and they love you, and you’re like, `I wish I could just flip a switch and love you back the way that you feel about me . . .’”
And then White put his arms around me and the other reporter and pulled us close.
“We’re getting deep, guys,” he said.
So, yes, it is an introspective White who begins his quest to add a third gold medal in the halfpipe to go with ones he won in Torino and Vancouver.

In certain ways, White is reminiscent of Michael Phelps, who had to decide if he wanted to resume competing after winning more than anyone had ever won.
“It’s just kind of a mental mindset, having to win after winning after winning,” White said. “It’s a great problem to have, but it’s finding that motivation, finding that drive.”
Of course, unlike Phelps, White also had to deal with the reality that his sport could put many, many stitches in his face. Sixty-two of them, in fact, the result of a run in New Zealand when a “cab double cork 1440” went badly awry. White had to be helicoptered to a hospital, where he was kept for five days.
“It’s kind of a nightmare,” White said. “It was the most visually jarring injury I’ve ever had. You can break a bone in your arm but you’re not looking at the bone broken. I’m sitting here, like, looking in the mirror and I couldn’t recognize myself. It was a really, really tough time. It was really hard for me and I really had to contemplate, do I really want this?
“At the end of the day for me, it was just a reality check. Just to ask myself, `Do you really want to pursue this?’ Because if you think about me stepping out on the snow, it means that I’m willing to have that happen to me again.”
White said he found his answer when he was training in Austria, mentally gearing himself up to do a cab double cork 1440 for the first time since his fall.
