Mirai Nagasu totally blew us away at the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics !
The 24-year-old just became the first American figure skater to land the rare and incredibly difficult triple axel during the Olympics!
Mirai completed the move during the free skate portion of the figure skating team event on Monday morning (February 12) in PyeongChang, South Korea.
The move, which requires a forward takeoff and three-and-a-half rotations in the air, has only ever been completed in competition by Mirai , Tonya Harding and Kimmie Meissner. However, they didn’t do it at the Olympics.
Congratulations Mirai!
Watch it all go down below…
