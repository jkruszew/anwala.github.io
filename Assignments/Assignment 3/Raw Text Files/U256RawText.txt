 Miller lbw b Chahal 39(28)
00:46 (IST)
OUT! There goes the big fish! A lucky break, one can say. That was full on middle-leg, ABD swing hard and straight to Rohit Sharma at fine leg. Is that the game?
AB de Villiers c Rohit b Hardik Pandya 26(18)
00:32 (IST)
OUT! What a catch this from Bhuvi! That was timed so well by Amla,and Bhuvi at long-on times his jump perfectly to take it both-handed, and he lets the ball go to regain his balance to take it again. 
Amla c Bhuvneshwar b Kuldeep Yadav 33(40) 
00:21 (IST)
OUT! Kuldeep strikes. Duminy advances, tries to flick the full ball but misses. He is hit low and is given. He was quite a way from the stumps though.
23:52 (IST)
28 overs... Target 202. 159 off 124 balls.
 
 
22:20 (IST)
OUT! That's the first blow. Bumrah gets this one to come in with the angle and Markram's drive misses the ball. He is hit on the back pad and is given. He reviews, but to no avail. 
Markram lbw b Bumrah 22(23)
21:17 (IST)
OUT! Bhuvi is run out. That was hit hard by Dhoni to long-on and Duminy's throw from long-on catches Bhuvi short at non-striker's.

21:03 (IST)

Shreyas Iyer c Chris Morris b Lungi Ngidi 18(21) 
20:14 (IST)

Rahane c Rabada b Lungi Ngidi 8(15)
20:07 (IST)
OUT! That's the wicket they wanted, it's Shikhar Dhawan, the centurion. Drives straight to mid-off where AB de Villiers does the needful. 
 Dhawan c de Villiers b Morne Morkel 109(105) 
19:09 (IST)
Uh-oh. Lightning has stopped play in Johannesburg. India are 200/2 in the 35th over. 
19:03 (IST)
CENTURY! Shikhar Dhawan becomes the first Indian to score a ton in his 100th ODI. This is his 13th 100. What a super knock. A huge smile on his face. Gets there with a boundary to long off. 
18:51 (IST)
OUT! Virat Kohli misses out on a ton by 25 runs. Morris bowls a back of a length delivery, Kohli tries to dispatch it over cover but finds Miller, who takes an easy catch. 
Kohli c Miller b Chris Morris 75(83)
18:09 (IST)
FIFTY! Taxes. Death. Virat Kohli's 50s and 100s. The new constants in life. Kohli once again charges down the track and lofts it over mid off. 
17:59 (IST)
FIFTY! 26th half-century for Shikhar Dhawan. Gets there with a couple of runs to fine leg. He has been top form in this series and is once again laying a solid foundation with Virat Kohli. 
16:52 (IST)
OUT! Rohit Sharma's misery in South Africa continues. Rabada pitches on a length and Rohit tried to play it with on open bat face off his back foot. The ball might have stopped a bit and took the leading edge. Rabada pouched a terrific return catch in his followthrough. The umpire was not sure whether it was a clean catch and sent it upstairs. Replays confirm that it was. 
Rohit c and b Rabada 5(13) 
16:19 (IST)
Pitch report: We can expect thunderstorms later. The surface looks better than it did for the (third) Test. A slight green tinge and not too much for the fast bowler. A few cracks as well, but an even covering of grass means that the pitch won't be two-paced (like the previous game), say Michael Holding and Shaun Pollock at the inspection. 
16:14 (IST)
South Africa: Hashim Amla, Aiden Markram, Jean-Paul Duminy, AB de Villiers, Heinrich Klaasen, David Miller, Chris Morris, Andile Phehlukwayo, Kagiso Rabada, Lungi Ngidi, Morne Morkel
 
16:13 (IST)
India: Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli, Ajinkya Rahane, Shreyas Iyer, MS Dhoni, Hardik Pandya, Kuldeep Yadav, Yuzvendra Chahal, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Jasprit Bumrah
16:02 (IST)
TOSS: The coin falls in India's favour and Virat Kohli opts to bat first. 
02:16 (IST)
So this brings us to the end of what has been a long ODI. It started on Saturday evening and ended on Sunday morning!

Heinrich Klaasen, Man of the Match:  I was 100 percent nervous. It is the best feeling of my career. Sometime you have to try (innovative shots) and sometimes they come off.

Aiden Markram:  Super relieved to have got over the line. Happy with the fightback. The lightening break was a blessing in disguise as it broke their momentum. The message to the batsmen was to put fear aside and play freely.

02:06 (IST)
Virat Kohli:  In the second innings, it became a T20 game. You have to give credit to South Africa, I think they deserved to win. We didn't grab our chances. The ball was getting a little wet in the second innings. The wicket became good to bat on. Spinners got a bit of turn but South Africa took their chances and they came off. If it was a full game, you never know. No-balls always hurt you, but you cant be too harsh on bowlers.
