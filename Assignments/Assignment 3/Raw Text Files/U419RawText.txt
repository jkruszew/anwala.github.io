JUST hours before the opening ceremony the Court of Arbitration for Sport dismissed an appeal made by 47 Russian athletes and coaches.
The Russians believed they had been incorrectly excluded from the Games but the decision was made to uphold the ban on their participation in PyeongChang.

Why are these athletes not able to compete?
The Russian doping controversy saw 43 Olympic medals stripped from both the summer and winter Games between 2002 and 2016. 
The ban of Russia was given following an investigation during the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi found state-sponsored doping in the country.
Of those who were contesting the ban, 28 athletes have had life bans from the Olympics lifted by the IOC in the last week.
This was when the CAS ruled there was insufficient evidence to support the idea that they had benefited from state-sponsored doping.
