On Wednesday, Helton addressed multiple position needs after several players exhausted their eligibility and others, including quarterback Sam Darnold, tailback Ronald Jones II, receiver Deontay Burnett and defensive lineman Rasheem Green, departed early for the NFL draft.
Helton said each incoming player would compete for a starting job, including Daniels.
The 6-foot-3, 205-pound quarterback was chosen Gatorade national player of the year and is the No. 2-rated quarterback in the nation by 247Sports.com.
As a junior he passed for 4,123 yards and 52 touchdowns, with four interceptions, leading Mater Dei to a 15-0 record and a CIF State Open Division title.
"He's probably smarter than the head coach and the quarterback coach," Helton said, chuckling. "I'm blown away by the way he picks things up."
Daniels, who committed in July, will forgo his senior year to enroll at USC in the fall.

St. Brown and Williams are among the top-rated receivers in California.
St. Brown, a five-star recruit who made a commitment last month, caught 72 passes for 1,320 yards and 20 touchdowns last season.
Williams, who shocked Oregon when he announced for USC, had 71 receptions for 1,157 yards and 13 touchdowns.
Helton also bolstered the defense Wednesday, adding a lineman, two linebackers and two cornerbacks.
Trevor Trout, a 6-4, 300-pound lineman from Chaminade Prep in St. Louis, committed in November.
Linebacker Eli'Jah Winston from Central Catholic in Portland, Ore., switched his commitment from Oregon to USC on Tuesday night.
Tuliaupupu made 63 tackles, including 46 solo, last season. He announced for USC among offers from UCLA, Notre Dame and Oklahoma.
The cornerbacks, Griffin and Taylor-Stuart, were among the final players to join USC's class.
Griffin, a five-star recruit, sat alongside his father, rapper Warren G, when he selected the Trojans over Alabama and Tennessee.
Taylor-Stuart also selected USC over several offers from schools in the Southeastern Conference.
"We were confident that we were in the lead," Helton said about Taylor-Stuart. "But you never know."
Helton credited relationships and open communication for his ability to close on signing day.
"Don't come to USC just because it's USC," Helton said. "Come because it fits you."
