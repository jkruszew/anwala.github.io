Mirai Nagasu of the United States competes in the Figure Skating Team Event  Ladies Single Free Skating on day three of the PyeongChang 2018 Winter Olympic Games at Gangneung Ice Arena on Feb. 12, 2018 in Gangneung, South Korea.
The women’s free skate competition Sunday night (Feb. 11) at the Olympics was as mesmerising for the action on the ice as it was for the athletes’ choice of music.     
Mirai Nagasu made history by becoming the first U.S. figure skater to land a triple axel in Olympic competition (and just the third overall), while Canadian Gabrielle Daleman caught the attention of the Twittersphere with her impressive performance to George Gershwin’s “Rhapsody in Blue”.    
Nagasu’s feat and Gershwin’s classic trended on Twitter (though many viewers, it turns out, only knew it from the United Airlines commercial) on an evening which mostly featured traditional and instrumental music.
Oscar winner Reese Witherspoon was one of many blown away by Nagasu‘s historic moment.
