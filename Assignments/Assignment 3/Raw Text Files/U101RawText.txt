German biathlete Laura Dahlmeier became the first double gold medalist of the Olympics by capturing the women's 10-kilometer pursuit at the Pyeongchang Games.
Dahlmeier previously won the 7.5-kilometer sprint on Sunday night.
With a healthy lead, Dahlmeier grabbed a German flag from a fan in the crowd about 50 meters from the finish line and began waving it as she crossed.
Dahlmeier entered the games ranked fourth in the world but had never won a gold medal. She is quickly becoming the darling of the German team.
After hitting all 10 targets in the sprint, Dahlmeier was nearly perfect again in her second race, hitting 19 of 20 shots to cruise to a victory by more than 29 seconds over Slovakia's Anastasiya Kuzmina, who edged France's Anais Bescond for silver.
