Winter Olympics goes mad for augmented reality

Samsung is a big sponsor of the Winter Olympics in its home nation of South Korea. Naturally, there was a bunch of cutting-edge technology on show in the opening ceremony. The event made use of a 5G network, Intel’s fleet of drones flying to create the Olympic rings and augmented reality both in and around the show.
Featuring a mix of the country’s cultural heritage and its technological future, we saw five children go on a journey from past to the future. These Goonies characters saw a future city where AR translations floated off the page, where self-driving cars hosted office meetings and everyone had augmented views of their environment, it was a heady mix of advertising and self-promotion, but in a country like South Korea, more likely to come true soon.
Some parts of the show were only visible to TV viewers, creating a better experience for the global audience, but expect that to be a common part of any such show in future.
News sites are also diving into AR too, with the New York times running its first augmented piece on some of America’s medal hopes for iOS ARKit users.  Expect more AR news as other providers get hold of the technology as the users of current generation smartphones get used to the benefits of the technology.
