Posted 19 Feb 2018 by Sara Davidson.
Gerard Pique has asked Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho to 'come and get him' as he looks for a way out of Barcelona.
The Barca centre-back is said to be unhappy at the Camp Nou.
The revelation comes on the back of rumours that Pique had stormed out of contract negotiations with the club.
'Pique was so angry at the salary that Barcelona offered him that he nearly crashed his car', said one source. 'He was shaking in rage.'
'I'd be surprised if a deal wasn't completed by the end of the week.'
A deal between the two sides for the Barca centre-back is expected to reach somewhere in the region of â‚¬40 million.
