“Before I begin, I’d just like to thank a few people. I want to thank my wife for being my rock throughout this whole process, and I want to thank my family and friends for their support. To Ron Courson, Thomas Settles, Carla Williams, Bryant Gantt, and everyone at UGA who was there for me from the very beginning — thank you. I’d also like to thank Dr. Star, Dr. Howell, Dr. Seiler, Dan Acker at Georgia Hand, Shoulder, & Elbow, and Piedmont Atlanta Hospital for their great work.”
