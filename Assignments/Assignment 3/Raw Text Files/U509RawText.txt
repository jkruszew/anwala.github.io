UPDATED 2:10 PM: The actual white tiger and K-Pop filled Opening Ceremony of the XXIII Winter Olympics occurred early on Friday morning in PyeongChang and was widely streamed and disseminated by the time NBC put on its primetime show last night.
Olympics Opening Ceremony: Katie Couric & Mike Tirico Prove Gold For NBC
A tape-delayed opener to the Games in South Korea that brought in 27.8 million viewers on the network AKA a chilly 12% drop from the official start of the last Winter Olympics just over four years ago in Sochi.
With geopolitical tensions, VIP seating plans, 1,200 pre-recorded morphing drones, VR and the newly minted team of Katie Couric and Mike Tirico , the Comcast-owned net tried hard to make the event seem almost as brand new and sparkling as the ice beneath 2010 figure skating Olympic champion Yuna Kim when she lit the cauldron at the end of the live across all time zones extravaganza.
Still, despite thousands of performances, a distinct injection of imagination and that always trivia filled Parade of Nations, and coming off a less than gold initial and unofficial first day , NBC also came up short in the ratings, again
In metered market results and with very little competition from the rest of the Big 4, the more than three and a half hour Opening Ceremony coverage of the South Korea-set Games snared a 16.9/5 rating.
Nowhere near even a bronze medal, that’s down 9% from what the February 7, 2014 Opening Ceremony of the XXII Winter Olympics from Sochi delivered in the early numbers. In fact last night’s coverage of the opener of the 2018 Winter Olympics currently stands as the 11th high rated non-U.S. Olympic opening ever.
Fronted by Olympics first timer Tirico and now four-time Opening Ceremony vet Couric, last night’s coverage hit its high in the 9 – 915 PM ET slot with a 18.6/31 as Team USA entered the stadium in South Korea.
In the final numbers, the Sochi Opening Ceremony pulled in drew 31.7 million viewers and an 8.7 rating among adults 18-49. A result that was a slip of 3% in viewership and 7% in 18-49 from the Opening Ceremony of Vancouver 2010,
Having said that, while its not quite winter apples to winter apples, the Opening Ceremony of the PyeongChang Olympics actually made it just across the finish line ahead of the Rio Summer Olympics of 2016. Last night’s shindig was up just over 2% in MM ratings over the tape-delayed opener from Brazil just under two years ago.
Elsewhere on broadcast Friday night, the CW’s Crazy Ex-Girlfriend (0.2 in adults 18-49; 620,000 viewers) and Jane the Virgin (0.3; 790,000) both held steady, with the latter actually increasing its audience to hit a season-high Live+same day viewership.
CBS’ Olympics counter-programming, Big Brother: Celebrity Edition, drew the biggest non-Olympics numbers of the night, 1.0 in adults 18-49, 4.3 million viewers while dropping -29% from Thursday in the demo. (1.8, 1.4, 1.0 for its three editions to date).
Following a Charlie Brown Valentine Day special (0.6, 2.8 million), Child Support (0.4, 2.2 million) hit a season lows in its finale. Fox reran the Who Shot Biggie and Tupac? special.
Overall, the total audience delivery for last night’s Opening Ceremony of the Olympics on NBC was 28.3 million when you tack on digital data. As was the case in the metered market ratings, viewerhip peaked in the 9 – 9:15 PM ET slot as the American athletes came out for the Parade of Nations. Additionally, because who doesn’t love more stats when it comes to the Olympics, here is the list of top non-U.S. Olympics Opening Ceremonies, and we warn you, there are a couple of ties:
