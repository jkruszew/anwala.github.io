Five-time world champion, two-time silver medalist of the Olympic Games Latvian skeletonist Martins Dukurs admitted that he did not understand why a Russian justified by the Sport Arbitration Court Alexander Tretyakov not allowed to the Games in Pyeongchang.
“I do not understand why, if he was acquitted, he is not here?  This topic is incomprehensible to me.  If guilty, then goodbye, at least for life.  And if you were acquitted – why is not he at the Olympics?
Am I guilty of it?  I find it very difficult to answer.  This he must ask.  Apparently, something was there, something happened there.  But it’s hard for me to discuss this now.
Did we communicate after this CAS decision?  Especially not.  We even greet each other barely.  I do not know why.  Maybe he thinks that we started this topic.  But you have to put yourself in our situation and look at it from the outside too.  Not so everything looks beautiful.
Frankly: I believed in what was written, and in the fact that there was such a scandal.  But I said: I am against such a system.  If they prove it, it’s their fault, and if they do not prove it, that’s another matter.
For me, Russia is not a problem.  We trained together with the Russians, they grew up at our base in Sigulda, we were together for 15 years.  It’s just insulting, very insulting, “Dukurs quotes RIA Novosti.
