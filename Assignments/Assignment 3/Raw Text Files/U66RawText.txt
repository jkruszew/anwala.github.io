National University bagged its third straight win to solidify its hold of the solo lead.
National University found University of the East as one tough customer.
The Lady Bulldogs needed to recover from a second set collapse and a third frame scare to eke out a 25-15, 18-25, 25-23, 25-19, win over the Lady Warriors to remain unscathed in the 80th UAAP women’s volleyball tournament at the FilOil Flying V Centre in San Juan.
Jaja Santiago was as sharp as always and delivered at crunch time to push NU at solo lead with a 3-0 win-loss record.     
The Lady Bulldogs extended their winning streak over UE to 16 straight since Season 72 as they sent the Lady Warriors to 0-3 slate. UE is on a 10-game losing slump since last year. 
Santiago scored 23 points off 18 attacks, four kill blocks and an ace while Roselyn Doria had 12 markers for NU, which bagged the win despite giving away 40 points off errors. Setter Jasmine Nabor chipped in 40 excellent sets in the Lady Bulldogs' 41 attack conversions.  
NU was ahead 18-17 in the second frame but a string of miscues and reception woes gave UE a chance to steal the set with a closing 8-0 rally.
The Lady Bulldogs were again put to the test in the third frame, going down 20-22 before setter Jasmine Nabor’s service winners sparked the fight back to take the set capped by a thunderous attack by Santiago at the middle.     
NU cruised in the fourth to finish off the Lady Warriors.
Mary Anne Mendrez and Shaya Adorador had 11 points each fwhile libero Kat Arado tallied 36 digs on a losing effort for UE.
