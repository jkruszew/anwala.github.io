You know what they say, "Money gets things done." So, don't forget to support me at Patreon.
I've never been crowdfunded before and I've always been motivated to do the things I love nonetheless. I'm sure things will get a lot better with the right support.

I've bought a lifetime license from Mirillis for Action! (that question mark is actually part of the game/screen-recording app's name, by the way. :P Although it would take over a day and 7 hours for this to upload (HD 1080p 60 FPS with quality set to ULTRA), I'm willing to keep my computer on for this to be uploaded, and hopefully, just as I bought Action!, I'll be able to upgrade my ISP. Can't wait to start playing other video games! :D
