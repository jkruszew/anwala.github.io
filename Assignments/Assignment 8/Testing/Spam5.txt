I am Mr. Roy Williams, the Chair person in charge of Treasury Department, International wire transfers of Benin Republic, Federal Ministry of Finance. You are to reply through this my official email address because this is to inform you that your fund was brought to my desk because the director & management of the WESTERN UNION & MONEY GRAM transfer have declared to transfer your fund into the government treasury account just because you can not pay the wire transfer fee. In reasoning wisely to this complain I told them to wait until I hear from you so that I will know the reason why you decide to reject such amount of money $2.4 Million USD which is your rightful & legal overdue inheritance payment just because of transfer fee.

The reason why I sent this email to you is because its your sweat and for this reason you still have this last chance to claim your fund if you can send $95 USD today because I have already arranged your wires ready for its daily wires to you but failing to do this, I will allow them to have power over your fund and I'm very sorry if you failed as this is the last chance.

Therefore, send the $95 USD immediately you receive this email today and email your full name and address to me if you want your $2.4 Million USD to be send to you by western union OR Money gram transfer but the maximum amount officially allow for it per day wire to you is $5000.00 USD per day until you receive your complete $2.4 Million USD from here. The second option is for you to send me the full detail of your bank account if you want your fund be fully transfer by direct bank to bank wire transfer to your account at once. After you have sent the $95 usd and email me the mtcn numbers, you are to indicate your wish to receive your funds as I have stated above and the funds will be released to you without any hitch, also be informed that ATM MASTER CARD can be mailed to you, you will be responsible for the courier charges of $150 usd only If you do not wish to use western union or wire transfer.
 .

Here is the western union or money gram information in the name of my accountant to avoid delay in activating your fund and remember that I have done my best for you and I will make sure that your wire will begin to be released to you from the moment you sent this $95 usd
